"""Differential-flatness state recovery for the systems in ``udaan``.

Central type
------------
:class:`Jet` — a value and all its time derivatives up to some order,
used as the input to every flat-to-state map in this package.

Per-system maps
---------------
:class:`Quadrotor` — flat-to-state recovery for a rigid-body quadrotor
with flat output ``(x_Q, ψ)``.
